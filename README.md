# stm32g031k8
There are several embedded projects with STM32 Cortec M0+ architecture. The projects were covered in the embedded software course given at the undergraduate level. 

- At this course, I have used STM32g031k8 board. There are some necesarry documents to understand the process. The documents are:
   1- STM32G031K8 Datasheet and Pinouts 
   2- RM0444 - Reference Manual for STM32G0x1 Devices
   3- Nucleo-G031K8 Schematic
   
   You can easily find the documents with the names. 
   
   
   IDE 
   
   - I have used STM32CubeIde at the course.
